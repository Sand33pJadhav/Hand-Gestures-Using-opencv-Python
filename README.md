Your Name & Date

Slide 2: Introduction
What is Asteroid?
A tool for fast, secure file transfers using SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol).
Ensures reliability, traceability, and scalability for enterprise-level data transmission.

Slide 3: High-Level Business Goals
Secure & Fast File Transfers – Ensuring minimal delay in data movement.
Scalability – Support for global data transmission across regions.
Reliability – Automated scheduling and monitoring of file transfers.
Traceability & Compliance – End-to-end tracking for audit and troubleshooting.

Slide 4: High-Level Technical Goals
Automated Alerting Mechanism:
Java Spring Boot service reads failure messages from MQ.
Raises alerts in Sockeye for failures.
Generic Implementation Across the Firm:
Any team (e.g., ABC team) can integrate by requesting Asteroid to publish failure messages in MQ.
Centralized failure monitoring without team-specific configurations.
Scalability:
Handles large files and multiple transmissions efficiently.

Slide 5: Why This Review?
Enhancing Reliability & Automation:
Manual monitoring was inefficient.
Needed automated alerts for failed transfers.
Ensuring Firm-Wide Standardization:
Created a generic model to be adopted across teams without custom changes.
Improving Incident Response Time:
Immediate failure detection through MQ integration and Sockeye alerts.

Slide 6: Key Features of Asteroid
Speed: Fast transmission using optimized SFTP.
Reliability: Supports scheduled and automated transfers.
Scalability: Global data transmission with high availability.
Traceability: End-to-end logging for tracking and compliance.
Batch Data Handling: Supports large files and multiple transfers simultaneously.
