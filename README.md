Your Name & Date

Slide 2: Introduction
What is Asteroid?
A tool for fast, secure file transfers using SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol).
Ensures reliability, traceability, and scalability for enterprise-level data transmission.

Slide 3: High-Level Business Goals
Secure & Fast File Transfers – Ensuring minimal delay in data movement.
Scalability – Support for global data transmission across regions.
Reliability – Automated scheduling and monitoring of file transfers.
Traceability & Compliance – End-to-end tracking for audit and troubleshooting.

Slide 4: High-Level Technical Goals
Automated Alerting Mechanism:
Java Spring Boot service reads failure messages from MQ.
Raises alerts in Sockeye for failures.
Generic Implementation Across the Firm:
Any team (e.g., ABC team) can integrate by requesting Asteroid to publish failure messages in MQ.
Centralized failure monitoring without team-specific configurations.
Scalability:
Handles large files and multiple transmissions efficiently.

Slide 5: Why This Review?
Enhancing Reliability & Automation:
Manual monitoring was inefficient.
Needed automated alerts for failed transfers.
Ensuring Firm-Wide Standardization:
Created a generic model to be adopted across teams without custom changes.
Improving Incident Response Time:
Immediate failure detection through MQ integration and Sockeye alerts.

Slide 6: Key Features of Asteroid
Speed: Fast transmission using optimized SFTP.
Reliability: Supports scheduled and automated transfers.
Scalability: Global data transmission with high availability.
Traceability: End-to-end logging for tracking and compliance.
Batch Data Handling: Supports large files and multiple transfers simultaneously.

Slide Title: Business Requirements & Current Challenges
Business Requirements:
✅ Secure & Fast File Transfers – Ensure reliable and encrypted SFTP-based transmission.
✅ Automated Failure Detection – Centralized alerting mechanism via MQ and Sockeye.
✅ Scalability & Standardization – Generic solution for seamless adoption across teams.
✅ Traceability & Compliance – End-to-end tracking for audit and troubleshooting.
✅ Minimized Downtime – Reduce manual intervention and improve issue resolution time.

Challenges with Current Process:
⚠ Manual Monitoring – Teams manually check file transfers, causing delays.
⚠ Lack of Centralized Alerts – No automated system to notify failures instantly.
⚠ Team-Specific Configurations – Different teams use different failure-handling approaches.
⚠ Delayed Incident Resolution – Failures are detected late, impacting business operations.
⚠ Scalability Issues – No firm-wide standardized mechanism for failure tracking.


Process to Create an Asteroid Job for File Transfer
Steps to Request an Asteroid Job:
1️⃣ Raise an Incident – Submit a request to the Asteroid team with required details.
2️⃣ Provide Source & Destination Details:

Source IP Address – Location from where the file will be sent.
Destination IP Address – Target system where the file needs to be transferred.
3️⃣ Define File Transfer Parameters:
File format, size, frequency, and transmission schedule.
4️⃣ Asteroid Team Configuration:
Team sets up the job and enables file transfer.
5️⃣ Testing & Validation:
Verify file transfer functionality and confirm successful transmission.
✅ Once setup is complete, the job will run as per the defined schedule.
